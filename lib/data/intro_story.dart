    'Long ago, humans learned how to travel between the stars.\n'
    'Over time, settlements formed across multiple systems. There is no single authority ruling the stars. Instead, trade connects them.\n'
    '\n'
    'Ships carry food, medicine, ore, and tools from place to place. Where ships move steadily, people thrive.\n'
    '\n'
    'Some systems chose cooperation early. They formed what is now known as the Inner Ring Alliance — Helios Reach, Solace Station, Kestrel Belt, and Meridian Outpost. Each contributes something different, and each benefits from shared fuel standards, docking agreements, and trade conventions.\n'
    '\n'
    'They learned that mutual benefit builds stronger relationships than greed over need.\n'
    '\n'
    'Beyond the Inner Ring, routes stretch farther. Infrastructure thins. Markets shift faster. Systems grow more self-reliant, though most still trade under shared conventions.\n'
    '\n'
    'Pirates exist… but not everywhere.\n'
    '\n'
    'Customs inspections vary by system. Reputation travels faster than fuel. Decisions about profit, patience, and fairness influence how others respond to you.\n'
    '\n'
    'There was once a captain named Tobias Ashcroft.\n'
    '\n'
    'He began with a ship much like yours. Through disciplined trade and careful expansion, he built one of the most influential trading networks ever recorded. Some say he prospered because he respected the balance between supply and need. Others believe he learned how to move markets in ways few understood.\n'
    '\n'
    'Every serious captain knows his name.\n'
    '\n'
    'You are not Tobias Ashcroft.\n'

    'This ship is built for learning, not fighting.\n'
    '\n'
    'What You Know\n'
    '\n'
    'Buying low and selling high creates profit.\n'
    'Some systems need certain goods more than others.\n'
    'Distance increases both opportunity and cost.\n'
    'Infrastructure shapes stability.\n'
    'Careful planning builds steady growth.\n'
    'Short-term greed can strain long-term opportunity.\n'
    '\n'
    'Starting System: Helios Reach\n'
    '(Inner Ring Alliance Hub)\n'
    '\n'
    'Helios Reach serves as the coordination center of the Inner Ring Alliance. While it does not govern the other systems, it maintains steady routing corridors and communicates regularly with its founding partners.\n'
    '\n'
    'Many captains begin here because stable markets allow careful learning before expansion.\n'
    '\n'
