    'HELIOS REACH': 'Helios Reach became known as the meeting place of the Inner Ring Alliance. It does not govern the other systems, but it connects them. Positioned along reliable jump corridors, it naturally grew into a central routing hub.\n\n'
      'When early trade routes expanded, system leaders met here to agree on shared fuel measurements, docking schedules, and communication standards. These agreements improved safety and reduced confusion between systems.\n\n'
      'Helios Reach speaks for the Inner Ring during interstellar discussions because it maintains the busiest routes and communicates with every member system regularly. It leads by coordination, not control.\n\n'
      'Stable prices and steady traffic make Helios Reach the calm center of the alliance.',
    'SOLACE STATION': 'Solace Station was established to support new captains and to provide secure storage for alliance goods. Its large depots and organized docking lanes allow it to absorb changes in supply without sharp price swings.\n\n'
      'As a founding member of the Inner Ring Alliance, Solace ensures that training and preparation remain priorities. Many new captains learn trade principles here before traveling farther.\n\n'
      'Solace contributes stability to the alliance by preventing small mistakes from becoming large losses.',
    'KESTREL BELT': 'Kestrel Belt supplies much of the Inner Ring\'s raw ore. Mining platforms orbit within dense asteroid clusters, extracting minerals used in ship repairs and construction.\n\n'
      'Because output depends on equipment maintenance and labor coordination, ore supply can vary. The alliance relies on Kestrel\'s resources, and in return, other systems ensure steady transport and fuel access.\n\n'
      'Kestrel\'s contribution reminds captains that production influences price and that resource systems strengthen the whole alliance.',
    'MERIDIAN OUTPOST': 'Meridian Outpost began as an agricultural expansion meant to reduce reliance on long-distance food shipments. Its farms and hydroponic facilities provide a steady supply of essential goods to the Inner Ring.\n\n'
      'Located nearer uncertain routes, Meridian experiences more variation in supply timing than the other alliance systems. When shipments are delayed, demand rises quickly.\n\n'
      'Meridian contributes resilience to the alliance by ensuring that essential goods remain available even when trade routes face disruption.',

    'ORIVAULT COMPLEX': 'Orivault Complex began as a research and fabrication colony founded by engineers who believed trade could be improved through better tools. Located just beyond the Inner Ring\'s most stable corridors, its founders saw opportunity in solving small inefficiencies that slowed cargo routes.\n\n'
      'Early in its development, storage capacity was limited and component supply inconsistent. Rather than expand agriculture or mining, leaders invested in innovation. Workshops and testing bays replaced wide depots. Engineers designed navigation modules, routing calculators, and precision fabrication systems that reduced waste across trade routes.\n\n'
      'It follows Inner Ring fuel standards and trade conventions but contributes primarily through technology rather than volume.\n\n'
      'Many captains visit to upgrade equipment and learn how information increases efficiency. Where others coordinate, this system optimizes.',
    'CANDESCENT YARD': 'Candescent Yard formed around large-scale energy testing platforms positioned slightly beyond the busiest Inner Ring corridors.\n\n'
      'Facilities are open, loud, and constantly active. Fuel efficiency trials, power-routing experiments, and propulsion calibration tests occur daily. Some succeed quickly. Others require redesign.\n\n'
      'Because storage reserves are limited, allocation must be deliberate. Energy surpluses can lower equipment costs temporarily. Shortages tighten availability just as quickly.\n\n'
      'It follows alliance standards but contributes through applied experimentation and practical innovation.',
    'FLUXHAVEN INSTITUTE': 'Fluxhaven Institute emerged from long-range propulsion studies designed to reduce fuel waste across expanding trade routes.\n\n'
      'Research centers specialize in thrust calibration, fuel-flow modeling, and engine alignment precision. Improvements here extend range while conserving resources.\n\n'
      'It shares performance data with alliance systems but prioritizes research over coordination gatherings.\n\n'
      'Measured experimentation defines its advancement.',
    'VELARIS ENCLAVE': 'Velaris Enclave developed as trade routes lengthened and crews remained away from stable systems longer.\n\n'
      'Design studios and fabrication ateliers produce immersive navigation systems and refined interior modules.\n\n'
      'Demand fluctuates based on trends and preference. Prices adjust rapidly when interest rises or shifts.\n\n'
      'It respects alliance standards while emphasizing experience as a component of exploration.',
    'GATEFORGE BASTION': 'Gateforge Bastion developed to prepare vessels for extended routes requiring structural reinforcement.\n\n'
      'Dry docks assemble reinforced hull frames, expanded cargo structures, and long-range containment systems.\n\n'
      'Preparation happens in workshops rather than conference halls.\n\n'
      'Captains strengthen capacity here before moving outward.',
    'REDHAVEN ANCHORPOINT': 'Redhaven Anchorpoint formed around a docking array along unpredictable jump corridors.\n\n'
      'Storage is limited. Supply rises and falls based on clustered arrivals.\n\n'
      'From here, routes extend toward developing systems and exploratory sectors.\n\n'
      'Many consider it the gateway to deeper expansion.',
    'STARTRAIL EXPANSE': 'Startrail Expanse formed when exploratory crews chose settlement beyond established hubs.\n\n'
      'Infrastructure is minimal. Cooperation sustains development.\n\n'
      'Supply cycles are smaller and less predictable. Prices shift more rapidly when demand changes.\n\n'
      'It maintains compatibility with Inner Ring standards while focusing on local capability.',
    'OUTERCREST NEXUS': 'Outercrest Nexus stands at the farthest established junction before uncharted corridors.\n\n'
      'Infrastructure is lean and practical. Large shipments significantly influence local supply.\n\n'
      'When cargo clusters, prices fall. When departures exceed arrivals, scarcity rises quickly.\n\n'
      'Many view it not as an endpoint, but as a beginning.',
